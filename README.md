This is my callable life coach! Lots of fun idea to be played with here.

## Tech

modal deploy tony_server
point vapi server API at modal serve

### Blog tools now via MCP

The blog tools (`blog_info`, `random_blog`, `read_blog_post`, `random_blog_url`, `blog_search`) are no longer served by our FastAPI app. They are provided by the Blog MCP server instead.

- Repo: [idvorkin/idvorkin-blog-mcp](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin-blog-mcp)
- Live MCP endpoint: `https://idvorkin-blog-mcp.fastmcp.app/mcp`

To enable these in the assistant, ensure `modal_readonly/tony_assistant_spec.json` contains the MCP tool entry in `assistant.model.tools`:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp",
  "function": { "name": "mcpTools" },
  "server": {
    "url": "https://idvorkin-blog-mcp.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    "secret": "SHOULD_BE_REPLACED_BY_ASSISTANT"
  }
}
```

If you're configuring via a generic config snippet, it should look like:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "function": { "name": "mcpTools" },
      "server": { "url": "https://mcp.zapier.com/api/mcp/s/********/mcp" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- Replace `secret` at runtime; `tony_server.py` injects `x-vapi-secret` for tools.
- Remove any legacy blog endpoints; they have been deleted from this repo.
